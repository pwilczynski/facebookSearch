    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
    <a class="emphasis" href="/">What'sHerFace</a> is a quick, personalized game where you are challenged
    to name several of your Facebook friends in succession while racing the clock. 
    </p>
    <p> Though fun, we also intend this game to help Facebook users consider their privacy exposure 
    online. Most consumers now know not to make their personal information public, but after years of social networking 
    (and hundreds or even thousands of connections) it is clear that many of our online 'friendships' 
    are simply (and sadly) no longer entact. 
    It is worth questioning whether these 'friendships' should remain privy to the same level of online confidence they once held?
